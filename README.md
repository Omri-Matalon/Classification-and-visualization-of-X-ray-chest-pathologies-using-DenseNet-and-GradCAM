# Classification-and-visualization-of-X-ray-chest-pathologies-using-DenseNet-and-GradCAM

## Intorduction
In this project, a medical diagnosis of X-ray images will be performed to predict the occurrence of several chest pathologies, including:

Atelectasis
Cardiomegaly
Consolidation
Edema
Effusion
Emphysema
Fibrosis
Hernia
Infiltration
Mass
Classification will be conducted by the CNN DenseNet model and visualization of model activity will be done using GradCAMs. The project will consist of several steps, including pre-processing an X-ray dataset, handling class imbalance, using transfer learning with DenseNet model, and measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.
